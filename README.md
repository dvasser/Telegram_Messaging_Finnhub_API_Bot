# Telegram_Messaging_Finnhub_API_Bot
In order to use this code you will need to download the Telegram app and message the BotFather, create a new bot. There is quite a bit of instrutions online how to do this and you will get a 'Your bot was created, here is your API bot token' message from the BotFather. You will also need to create an account on Fibnnhub and get a free API key. Afer that you will have to import the FinnhubConnector object from my Github repo: https://github.com/dvasser/Finnhub-API-Connector. In the top of the .py file in this repo, you will enter your Finnhub API key and your Telegram Bot token. After that you will be ready to run the code. When the code is running, in order to start the bot, find it in Telegram's search menu and message-  /hello
This will trigger a response with instructions how to use the bot. If your computer is off/code isn't running the bot will not work, so it's best to use your PC only for testing purposes and if you'd like to keep the bot always running it is best to host it on a server such as PythonAnywhere or AWS. Enjoy!
